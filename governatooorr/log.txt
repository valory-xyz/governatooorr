This will be added as a controller to the NameWrapper, and the NameWrapper will be added as the new controller of the existing .eth Base Registrar.\n\nWe will also replace the current reverse registrar with a new reverse registrar which allows the new controller to set the reverse on registration, as well as adds support for the owner of contract to retrospectively claim their reverse node.\n\n## Specification\n\nNew instances of the Name Wrapper, Reverse Registrar, and .eth registrar controller have been deployed to mainnet at these addresses:\n\n* NameWrapper: `0xD4416b13d2b3a9aBae7AcD5D6C2BbDBE25686401`\n* ReverseRegistrar: `0xa58E81fe9b61B5c3fE2AFD33CF304c454AbFc7Cb`\n* ETHRegistrarController: `0x253553366Da8546fC250F225fe3d25d0C782303b`\n* PublicResolver: `0x231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63`\n\nThey have been configured, and ownership has been transferred to the DAO.The new Public Resolver is set as the default resolver on the reverse registrar.\n\nThis executable proposal will execute the following calls to complete the contract upgrades:\n\n1. Call `registrar.addController(newNameWrapperAddress)`\n2. Call `ens.setSubnodeOwner(namehash('reverse'), labelhash('addr'), newReverseRegistrarAddress)`\n3.

This will reduce the transactions required from 4 to 2 (for adding records + reverse). This will be added as a controller to the NameWrapper, and the NameWrapper will be added as the new controller of the existing .eth Base Registrar.\n\nWe will also replace the current reverse registrar with a new reverse registrar which allows the new controller to set the reverse on registration, as well as adds support for the owner of contract to retrospectively claim their reverse node.\n\n## Specification\n\nNew instances of the Name Wrapper, Reverse Registrar, and .eth registrar controller have been deployed to mainnet at these addresses:\n\n* NameWrapper: `0xD4416b13d2b3a9aBae7AcD5D6C2BbDBE25686401`\n* ReverseRegistrar: `0xa58E81fe9b61B5c3fE2AFD33CF304c454AbFc7Cb`\n* ETHRegistrarController: `0x253553366Da8546fC250F225fe3d25d0C782303b`\n* PublicResolver: `0x231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63`\n\nThey have been configured, and ownership has been transferred to the DAO.The new Public Resolver is set as the default resolver on the reverse registrar.\n\nThis executable proposal will execute the following calls to complete the contract upgrades:\n\n1. Call `registrar.addController(newNameWrapperAddress)`\n2. Call `ens.setSubnodeOwner(namehash('reverse'), labelhash('addr'), newReverseRegistrarAddress)`\n3. Call `setInterface` on the resolver for .eth with the interface IDs and contract addresses of the new .eth registrar controller and namewrapper.

This will reduce the transactions required from 4 to 2 (for adding records + reverse). This will be added as a controller to the NameWrapper, and the NameWrapper will be added as the new controller of the existing .eth Base Registrar.\n\nWe will also replace the current reverse registrar with a new reverse registrar which allows the new controller to set the reverse on registration, as well as adds support for the owner of contract to retrospectively claim their reverse node.\n\n## Specification\n\nNew instances of the Name Wrapper, Reverse Registrar, and .eth registrar controller have been deployed to mainnet at these addresses:\n\n* NameWrapper: `0xD4416b13d2b3a9aBae7AcD5D6C2BbDBE25686401`\n* ReverseRegistrar: `0xa58E81fe9b61B5c3fE2AFD33CF304c454AbFc7Cb`\n* ETHRegistrarController: `0x253553366Da8546fC250F225fe3d25d0C782303b`\n* PublicResolver: `0x231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63`\n\nThey have been configured, and ownership has been transferred to the DAO.The new Public Resolver is set as the default resolver on the reverse registrar.\n\nThis executable proposal will execute the following calls to complete the contract upgrades:\n\n1. Call `registrar.addController(newNameWrapperAddress)`\n2. Call `ens.setSubnodeOwner(namehash('reverse'), labelhash('addr'), newReverseRegistrarAddress)`\n3. Call `setInterface` on the resolver for .eth with the interface IDs and contract addresses of the new .eth registrar controller and namewrapper.

This will reduce the transactions required from 4 to 2 (for adding records + reverse). This will be added as a controller to the NameWrapper, and the NameWrapper will be added as the new controller of the existing .eth Base Registrar.\n\nWe will also replace the current reverse registrar with a new reverse registrar which allows the new controller to set the reverse on registration, as well as adds support for the owner of contract to retrospectively claim their reverse node.\n\n## Specification\n\nNew instances of the Name Wrapper, Reverse Registrar, and .eth registrar controller have been deployed to mainnet at these addresses:\n\n* NameWrapper: `0xD4416b13d2b3a9aBae7AcD5D6C2BbDBE25686401`\n* ReverseRegistrar: `0xa58E81fe9b61B5c3fE2AFD33CF304c454AbFc7Cb`\n* ETHRegistrarController: `0x253553366Da8546fC250F225fe3d25d0C782303b`\n* PublicResolver: `0x231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63`\n\nThey have been configured, and ownership has been transferred to the DAO.The new Public Resolver is set as the default resolver on the reverse registrar.\n\nThis executable proposal will execute the following calls to complete the contract upgrades:\n\n1. Call `registrar.addController(newNameWrapperAddress)`\n2. Call `ens.setSubnodeOwner(namehash('reverse'), labelhash('addr'), newReverseRegistrarAddress)`\n3.

This will reduce the transactions required from 4 to 2 (for adding records + reverse). This will be added as a controller to the NameWrapper, and the NameWrapper will be added as the new controller of the existing .eth Base Registrar.\n\nWe will also replace the current reverse registrar with a new reverse registrar which allows the new controller to set the reverse on registration, as well as adds support for the owner of contract to retrospectively claim their reverse node.\n\n## Specification\n\nNew instances of the Name Wrapper, Reverse Registrar, and .eth registrar controller have been deployed to mainnet at these addresses:\n\n* NameWrapper: `0xD4416b13d2b3a9aBae7AcD5D6C2BbDBE25686401`\n* ReverseRegistrar: `0xa58E81fe9b61B5c3fE2AFD33CF304c454AbFc7Cb`\n* ETHRegistrarController: `0x253553366Da8546fC250F225fe3d25d0C782303b`\n* PublicResolver: `0x231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63`\n\nThey have been configured, and ownership has been transferred to the DAO.The new Public Resolver is set as the default resolver on the reverse registrar.\n\nThis executable proposal will execute the following calls to complete the contract upgrades:\n\n1. Call `registrar.addController(newNameWrapperAddress)`\n2. Call `ens.setSubnodeOwner(namehash('reverse'), labelhash('addr'), newReverseRegistrarAddress)`\n3. Call `setInterface` on the resolver for .eth with the interface IDs and contract addresses of the new .eth registrar controller and namewrapper.

This will reduce the transactions required from 4 to 2 (for adding records + reverse). This will be added as a controller to the NameWrapper, and the NameWrapper will be added as the new controller of the existing .eth Base Registrar.\n\nWe will also replace the current reverse registrar with a new reverse registrar which allows the new controller to set the reverse on registration, as well as adds support for the owner of contract to retrospectively claim their reverse node.\n\n## Specification\n\nNew instances of the Name Wrapper, Reverse Registrar, and .eth registrar controller have been deployed to mainnet at these addresses:\n\n* NameWrapper: `0xD4416b13d2b3a9aBae7AcD5D6C2BbDBE25686401`\n* ReverseRegistrar: `0xa58E81fe9b61B5c3fE2AFD33CF304c454AbFc7Cb`\n* ETHRegistrarController: `0x253553366Da8546fC250F225fe3d25d0C782303b`\n* PublicResolver: `0x231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63`\n\nThey have been configured, and ownership has been transferred to the DAO.The new Public Resolver is set as the default resolver on the reverse registrar.\n\nThis executable proposal will execute the following calls to complete the contract upgrades:\n\n1. Call `registrar.addController(newNameWrapperAddress)`\n2. Call `ens.setSubnodeOwner(namehash('reverse'), labelhash('addr'), newReverseRegistrarAddress)`\n3. Call `setInterface` on the resolver for .eth with the interface IDs and contract addresses of the new .eth registrar controller and namewrapper.

This will reduce the transactions required from 4 to 2 (for adding records + reverse). This will be added as a controller to the NameWrapper, and the NameWrapper will be added as the new controller of the existing .eth Base Registrar.\n\nWe will also replace the current reverse registrar with a new reverse registrar which allows the new controller to set the reverse on registration, as well as adds support for the owner of contract to retrospectively claim their reverse node.\n\n## Specification\n\nNew instances of the Name Wrapper, Reverse Registrar, and .eth registrar controller have been deployed to mainnet at these addresses:\n\n* NameWrapper: `0xD4416b13d2b3a9aBae7AcD5D6C2BbDBE25686401`\n* ReverseRegistrar: `0xa58E81fe9b61B5c3fE2AFD33CF304c454AbFc7Cb`\n* ETHRegistrarController: `0x253553366Da8546fC250F225fe3d25d0C782303b`\n* PublicResolver: `0x231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63`\n\nThey have been configured, and ownership has been transferred to the DAO.The new Public Resolver is set as the default resolver on the reverse registrar.\n\nThis executable proposal will execute the following calls to complete the contract upgrades:\n\n1. Call `registrar.addController(newNameWrapperAddress)`\n2. Call `ens.setSubnodeOwner(namehash('reverse'), labelhash('addr'), newReverseRegistrarAddress)`\n3. Call `setInterface` on the resolver for .eth with the interface IDs and contract addresses of the new .eth registrar controller and namewrapper.

This will reduce the transactions required from 4 to 2 (for adding records + reverse). This will be added as a controller to the NameWrapper, and the NameWrapper will be added as the new controller of the existing .eth Base Registrar.\n\nWe will also replace the current reverse registrar with a new reverse registrar which allows the new controller to set the reverse on registration, as well as adds support for the owner of contract to retrospectively claim their reverse node.\n\n## Specification\n\nNew instances of the Name Wrapper, Reverse Registrar, and .eth registrar controller have been deployed to mainnet at these addresses:\n\n* NameWrapper: `0xD4416b13d2b3a9aBae7AcD5D6C2BbDBE25686401`\n* ReverseRegistrar: `0xa58E81fe9b61B5c3fE2AFD33CF304c454AbFc7Cb`\n* ETHRegistrarController: `0x253553366Da8546fC250F225fe3d25d0C782303b`\n* PublicResolver: `0x231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63`\n\nThey have been configured, and ownership has been transferred to the DAO.The new Public Resolver is set as the default resolver on the reverse registrar.\n\nThis executable proposal will execute the following calls to complete the contract upgrades:\n\n1. Call `registrar.addController(newNameWrapperAddress)`\n2. Call `ens.setSubnodeOwner(namehash('reverse'), labelhash('addr'), newReverseRegistrarAddress)`\n3. Call `setInterface` on the resolver for .eth with the interface IDs and contract addresses of the new .eth registrar controller and namewrapper.
